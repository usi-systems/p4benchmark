 * This routine parses a packet, expecting Ethernet, IP, and UDP headers.
 * It extracts the UDP source and destination port numbers along with the UDP
 * packet length by casting structs over a pointer that we move through
 * the packet.  We can do this sort of casting safely because libpcap
 * guarantees that the pointer will be aligned.
 *
 * The "ts" argument is the timestamp associated with the packet.
 *
 * Note that "capture_len" is the length of the packet *as captured by the
 * tracing program*, and thus might be less than the full length of the
 * packet.  However, the packet pointer only holds that much data, so
 * we have to be careful not to read beyond it.
